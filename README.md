# New Mesh Map

A new Mesh Map providing a web view on your local AREDN mesh network.

### Installation

To install simply copy all the files into your chosen place on your favorite web server. Then rename ```cofig.js.example``` to ```config.js``` after changing the various fields for your specific requirements.

### Mesh Map Data

The data files, including ```out.js```, contains the node data for the mesh map. This is generated by a seperate program https://github.com/kn6plv/MeshInfo. Run this application periodically to generate and update node information, and copy the various output files (all named ```out.X```) to the ```data/``` subdirectory of your NewMeshMap install.  Using a ```cron``` job is an easy way to automate this.

### Realtime Map Data

To use realtime map data, remove the ```<script src="data/out.js"></script>``` tag from ```index.html``` and replace it with ```<script src="walk.js"></script>```. When you load the map, the walk script will start from your localnode and walk your local mesh, updating the map as it goes.
